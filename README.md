A P2P learning platform

Unemployment among the youth has been a nightmare in Africa. What pains most is that the skilled youth are suffering the most which is ironical because they have value to offer. This is painting a picture of an unfair world and this is what we aim to address.

With our solution, we are increasing opportunities to the skilled youth to be able to offer their knowledge to learners of a particular blockchain aspect. We are focusing on a blockchain learning platform because we are passionate about this amazing technology and we encourage its education to have mass adoption to enable the technology work for everyone.
